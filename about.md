<article class="f4">
<p class="f4">Born and raised in Accra, Ghana. Studied Computing Science at Staffordshire University and Coventry University. I've worked for Petra Trust, Geowox, Qoncept and many others. Currently, i work as a software engineering consultant at Andela.</p>
<p class="f4 pt2">I'm full-stack developer. I'm at home writing REST APIs in Ruby, Go or Java. On the other side, you'll find me building accessible and performant React/Ember applications that sit on top of those APIs. Most of all, I'm very excited about building software that makes users happy. I have been also known to like using boring technology
