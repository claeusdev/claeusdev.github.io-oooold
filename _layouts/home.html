  <p class="f4">Hi I'm Nana, I am a Computer programmer based in Rotterdam.</p>
  <p class="f4">I am mostly interested in building web applications with JavaScript, TypeScript and Ruby.
  In my spare time i am learning how to build distributed systems with Golang. I also try my best to contribute to 
  some of the open source projects i enjoy using. </p>
  <p class="f4">When i'm not coding, i am probably trying to complete a walking challenge, 
    spending some time with early career engineers or playing some video games.</p>
